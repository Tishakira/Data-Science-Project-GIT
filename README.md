Database Management System (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of software tools/programs that access, process, and manipulate data.
DBMS provides a well-managed and synchronized data, making data handling easy and providing an integrated view of an organization. 
In the area of database management, the data is arranged in two ways which are Relational Databases (SQL) and Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL).
While relational databases organize data into structured tables, non-relational databases use various flexible data models like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, and wide-column stores.
The choice between relational and non-relational databases depends largely on the nature of the data and the requirements of the application.
This powerpoint focuses on their key characteristics and applications.
